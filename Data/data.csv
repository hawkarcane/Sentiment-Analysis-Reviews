"A good option for a restaurant like meal at home. Nice selection of entrees, delivery service is very good."

"All the items I've bought from Munchery have been good, and some of them have been excellent. And they arrive on time. I wish they had dessert, but I'm better off without it."

"Food continues to be mostly very good, however quality is not consistent. Especially with condiments and sides in the smaller plastic containers. They often seem to be added last minute and often not that complementary to the dish."
Food is always prepared wonderfully and tastes delicious. I appreaciate the healthy and fresh ingredients. Never been disappointed.
Food is becoming repetitive Prices are going way up Membership is worthless w high prices No organic food
Food is great and for those who have a hard time digesting foods this is food that can be ate without causing tons of pain!
"Food is great, and it is always delivered at the time requested. You can order up to a week in advance, or just today for dinner. I love the flexibility."
food sometimes is good sometimes is meh.
Food started out good; then fall apart quickly. No taste; not provided as shown; lack texture or taste.
Food tastes fresh and delicious.
Food was surprisingly delicious. The steak was better than I've had in restaurants. Customer service was excellent. They kept me updated with texts and delivered on time with a smile.
"For the most part, the quality and taste of food is good; however, the execution component tends to be inconsistent (e.g., undercooked grains or overcooked proteins)."
Fresh and delicious food along with prompt delivery.

Good food at an OK price. Delivery has on time.
"Good food, good service, not much variety from week to week"
"Good food, healrhy options, convenient."
"Good products, efficient delivery"
"Good variety, with vegetarian options. Recently there have been some quality issues, such as missing ingredients or very fatty meat. There's less variety in the kids meals than there used to be -- we miss the old favorites from last fall."
"Good, fresh ingredients, clear instructions, and on-time delivery."
"Good, healthy food. Great delivery service. Great customer service."
"Great choice of food. Arrived at a good time. Seasoned well, very easy to put together. Only wish the portions we're a bit larger. Fresh ingredients, tasty...just would have liked more."

Great food and convenient delivery. Not cheap but quality of food and ease of having a great dinner makes it worth it.
Great food and easy prep! Super healthy options and good prices! Definitely recommended all my family to try

Great Food and the delivery drivers are so nice. Just pricing is higher than a year ago.

Great food. Restaurant quality in your own home.

great meals could use a little larger lemon & lime wedges
Great portion and very tasty

Great service and food.
"Great service and good food. Some entrees have pretty high sodium content, so one star downgrade for that only."
"Great service, excellent food and reasonable pricing"
Great service. But limited entree options and sides. Often the meals are late. Quality of food sometimes inconsistent
GREAT TASTING FOOD
Great tasting quality food. Portions are a bit small for men and growing teens.
"Great tasty, balanced, nutritious food . Just slow down a little bit on the salt. Delivery is reliable and website is easy and efficient. My husband and I love Munchery. Please stay affordable though"
Have been ordering dinners from Munchery for over 2 years - good quality entrees reasonably priced and delivered to your door.
Have been ordering Munchery for many months now and have been extremely pleased with every meal ordered for my family. I recommend Munchery to anyone that asks.
Having premade dinners delivered from Munchery has been a huge help! The food is very good and it is so convenient. The cost is similar to buying premade food from the grocery store deli. I highly recommend Munchery.
"Healthy, fresh ingredients. Very convenient and reliable. Good vegetarian options."
"I absolute love the convenience of Munchery, and I think it is a pretty good value as well. I just wish that they would offer more low carb options and offer a protein with just vegetables."
"I almost never write reviews but munchery is one of my favorite services I've ever used. Reasonably priced, healthy, delicious meals delivered at your leisure. I can't reccomend highly enough."
"I am happy with overall taste, variety, quality of the food. Some of the dishes are too salty for me. Wish they make the dishes a bit less salty."
I continue to order from Munchery because I think 98 % of the meals I have ordered have been very good...delivered promptly and excellent. 
I enjoy the opportunity to be able to order excellent taste and deliciously prepared food over the internet that I enjoy eating.
"I enjoyed my dinner very much. The taste was very good. The portion was lite. The cost for the portion, I thought was a little high. With that said, I would buy from Munchery again. Their food is delicious."
I find Munchery very helpful. It has a varied menu with mostly food that I enjoy and good customer service. It solves dinner with minimal effort.
"I have stomach issues. For the most part I am able to find good, healthy foods from Munchery that I am able to eat. 5 stars all the way"
"I have used service for a year,, one goof with order & fixed immediately. Absolutely five star service . I would make the deserts larger."
"I highly recommend Munchery. Top-quality ingredients, reasonable prices."
I like how easy it is to order onine whenever I want without having to use a recurring schedule. I like the different meal options and variety. The meals are tasty and filling.
I like Munchery very much but I do not like that they have already run out of dishes but the time I get my daily email
I like their food mostly. The only problem I sometimes have is if there is too much spice for me.
"I love Munchery and the very few times I have had an issue, they have more than made it right!"
I love Munchery. Food is good and as represented. Good variety and very easy to warm up. It’s not cheap but well worth it for what you get. Delivery is very reliable and fast!
"I love Munchery. The food is always tasty and I usually get 1 1/2 servings from each meal. I order from them frequently, so unfortunatley I have had my share of the delivery being late, so that is what -1 star is for."
"I love that there are companies around like Munchery. My parents are elderly and really have no desire to cook anymore. This is perfect for them, and I know they are getting a well balenced meal for dinner ."
I love the convenience of the service and the quality of the food. I wish that the choices would be more varied. I like that we can choose the delivery times. I also like earning rewards for free delivery and coupons.
"I love the food, and all ways comes on time. Cool Service ..."
"I love the service and convenience of Munchery. That said, the menus are boring. Same dishes repetitively. And the quality of the food is questionable. And the amount of spices are a bit over the top. Munchery needs to change up menus!"
I love the taste of everything especially the side dish..it was delicious!
i love this food and service my only complaint is that often the steak is too done
I love this food delivery service....the food is always good. Fresh and easy to warm up. I love everything about this.
I love this service! The food is excellent and the portions are substantial. I also really appreciate being able to only order one meal at a time. No minimums. I highly recommend this company.
I order from them religiously. Deliveries are always on time and the food is always good. Order by 2pm get it by 4pm. Who could ask for anything more?
I ordered munchery for the first time last night and my dinner was delicious!
I recommend them to everyone! There food has yet to disappoint. My husband and I did this when we first had our baby! It saved us! Now we can't stop.
"I think they're great! Great food, great taste, great variety, great service. They just need to bring back their deserts ((o*r am I the only one squaking about this)!!"
I thought the flavors were delicious and the portion size just right. Delivery was on time as ordered. Nothing to complain about. Will be using again.
I thought the service was great and the food was amazing. I will order again and will recommend to friends.
"I throughly appreciate the quality and variety Munchery offers. After any long day, it is so good to have a culinary treat so handy!"
I tried Munchery for the first time in August. I ordered 3 meals and found each to be delicious with subtle seasonings.
"I use munchery several times a week. I find the menu interesting and varied, the food is tasty, the delivery convenient, and I appreciate being able to select healthy meals when I want to."
"I used to use them, but they've taken away the only delivery hour (7-8) that I can use as I work for a living and don't get home until 7 or 7:30."
"I was given a gift certificate for munchery. After trying three different items, I was surprised how good and fresh each item was and signed up for a membership."
"I would prefer there were more choices of non-spicy foods. Otherwise, I feel , the quality is high. I especially enjoy the chicken dishes. The delivery service is top notch!"
"Inviting menu, excellent preparation, prompt delivery. Delivery charges plus optional tip a little expensive."
"It is obvious that they are trying to expand their menu to cover different places around the world, which is nice but not my taste. The other thing I have noticed is a decline in service and food quality and a big increase in price. I rarely order from them any more."
It's so convenient. The meals and sides are healthy---even have nutritional values on each item.
"I've been perusing Munchery for 2 + years. Good food, incredible customer service (for the couple of times I needed it). My go to place to eat most of the week really :)"
"Just the best delicious meals delivered to your door,what more can I say"
"Just tried this last night - very happy, everything worked smoothly and food was a perfect side portion and made a very nice dinner."
Love Munchery! Munchery's food and delivery is always spot on! I order a lot as I don't always want to spend hours in the kitchen cooking and Munchery saves me!!
Love the food and service. It's a great break to have it delivered once a week and take a break from cooking. Thank you Munchery!
Love the service and food options. Delivery wonderful.
"More often than not, food is delivered outside of preferred window."
"Most of the meals are pretty good. Some excellent, and a few miss the mark."
Most of the Munchery meals I've had are very good. Delivery folks are always pleasant. Pricing is good.
MOST TIMES THE FOOD IS GREAT. SOMETIMES CERTAIN ITEMS ARE A LITTLE SPICY. NEED TO KNOW IN REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASE IF ITEM IS SPICY.
"Mostly good, but prices have gone up while quality has faltered. Lots of errors."
Much healthier option for food delivery! I order about 2-3 meals at a time and stretch them over 3-4 days. Sick of my own cooking!
"Munchery delivers on time. They are best for seafoods, particularly salmon. They have a limited variety of entrees. They would help themselves if they put the calorie count on all items."
"Munchery food is good, consistent, reliable and easy to order."
"Munchery has become a staple in my meal planning. I use Munchery at least once a week, ordering 2 to 3 meals at a time. I would probably starve without them!"
"Munchery has been a godsend for us in LA. Wonderful, easy to prepare (microwave) meals. Good service Fair prices."
"Munchery has been really a great experience. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5, is that I just wish there was a broader offer and more of a focus on healthy (low cal) options"
Munchery is a good alternative to cook the menu are great... I would like them to expand it a little more... have more side dishes options.
Munchery is a great service; food is fresh and delicious!
"Munchery is a lifesaver for busy parents everywhere! Food is great, choices are fun and dynamic, ordering is a snap and delivery is flawless. Highly highly recommend!"
"Munchery is awesome. Living in nyc, I am never home so I don’t have enough time to cook. I order munchery twice a week to my office for dinner and am never disappointed."
Munchery is delicious food at a reasonable price. Lots better than eating out. Delivery very timely.
"Munchery is fantastic! Delicious meals, healthy, and convenient for a busy family or working individuals - Munchery works for everyone!"
Munchery is fine when I have a packed day but it's nothing I get excited about. I miss the Cesar Salad - I looked forward to that dish actually but they no longer carry it.
Munchery is part of our family now. We rely on Munchery at least 3 to 4 days a week.
Munchery is superb. We have never been disappointed. Every order is delivered on time and all of the various options are delicious. I cannot recommend them too highly!
Munchery is the best! I love that you can plan your week out in advance and the food is always changing.
"Munchery meals are always on time and always delicious. Prices are fair, too. We highly recommend."
Munchery's food is delicious. Its delivery people are prompt and extremely pleasant. I am so glad this service is available to people who are tired of cooking.
Needs to add more people to answer their phones!! Needs more salad dressing for the salads & yogurt for example the yogurt parfait (barely any yogurt there). Majority of the meals are basically good. Only a few are bad.
"On trend. On taste. On time. Healthy, easy, quality, variety. Feel great about ordering in."
One dish was pretty bad. Very disappointing. If I was in a restaurant it would have been sent back. Poor quality.
Ordering was easy. The meal arrived on time. The food was excellent. Far better than food from your standard meal delivery service.
Poition sizes could be a little larger and not so much rice. Salads should have more dressing.All people do not like a dry salad
"PORK CHOP WAS THICK AND HUGE, SIDES WERE SMALL, DELIVERY WAS A HEAD OF DELIVERY TIME, WHICH WAS GOOD."
Price somewhat high for some of the entrees. Salt contents too high
prices creeping up over time;
"Quick delivery and a variety of choices . Highly recommended for the nights you need a break from cooking. . Excellent kids menu, too"
"Really good delivery options, everyone can pick something they like!"
"Really good, reliable meal delivery. Overall, I'm very happy with the quality. They offer a variety of meals so it doesn't get boring. Customer service has been friendly and helpful."
"Reliable deliveries; decent healthy food, quick and easy without committment."
"Reliable, good food, good service, reasonable prices."
So far the only problem I have had with Munchery is when I ask for he afternoon delivery and I don't get it util 8:00 when the time line is 5:00
So much better than the others meal delivery services such as Hello Fresh. Much more flexible in terms meal options. Excellent app!
Some dishes have been too spicy for me. Spicy should be on the side. I didn't receive one dish and did not know how to contact Munchery.
"Some of the meals are great and some are not so great, my son and I have been customers since they opened."
Sometimes the food is a bit dry. But most of the time very good.
stellar service and love the food
"Stopped membership. One really great dish - roasted 1/2 game hen - delish - but never had it again. Too much ""new world stuff"". Too old to leave old favs behind (too old to cook at 85 -- moving to another)"
"Tasty and quality meals, reliable delivery service, reasonable prices"
Tasty food delivered reliably to your home
"Tasty food, healthy, good portion sizes, free delivery, cheaper than takeout. What's not to like? Especially good for busy parents."
"Terrific food and the service is excellent. Scott, the delivery guy always sends texts letting you know when he's arriving."
The choices are not varied enough. Sometimes nothing is appealing ..all the same
The delivery is always spot on! There is a wide variety of food for all kinds of tastes. The chefs are from restaurants that are well known in the bay area and locally. The instructions are simple. I have recommended Munchery to several people.
The dinners are fresh and delicious and a wide variety of choices each day delivered right to our door. We would recommend this service highly.
"The food is amazing! They are quick to get back with you if you have questions. It's an amazing delivery service to ""fall in love with dinner as a family"" again!"
"The food is great, the service is top-notch and I have no complaints!"
The food is great. Only reason for only 4 stars is I'm a vegetarian. Sometimes have to get 2 meals of the same kind.
"The food is quite good. But I'm only giving 4 points for two reason - not enough vegetarian choices and the over use of chili flakes, jallapeno, and other hot spices. Almost every dish now has one of these spices in it."
THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL
The food was excellent!! The taste was delicious & portion was plenty!!
The food was in a cute package and had clear and easy directions. The delivery was spot on!
"The food was wonderful and enough, the price of the meal is OK. The food was really good, will order on Munchery again and I have already told my friends about it. If you haven't tired it you should."
The meal was delicious 😋 visually appealing as well.
The meals are variable in quality.and quantity and the produce is more and more often near the end of it's life before it arrives
The Munchery creates great quality deliciously inventive dinners!
the Munchery food is excellent. The service is great too. Just wish that they delivered on weekends too!
The only complaint I have is that sometimes their prices seem too high.
The website is easy to use and the food is fresh and delicious with generous portions. Delivery is on time and what more can you expect?
They could have more gluten free choices but otherwise a great service.
"They have good variety of meals and sides. When I order, I choose items for the week. The entres are really big and I can split them into two meals. Also the kids meals are good too."
"Though many recipes are tasty, there still is the awareness that they are not right out of oven."
Very few choices of low-sodium AND high protein foods. Too many items that appeal to younger customers who enjoy exotic food
Very honest food delivery service - tasty food
very satisfied !!!!!!!!
Very tasty meals. I wish they would lower the sodium in some entrees
Very well prepared and great flavor
"We have been getting Munchery dinners for several years now. Good choices, good meals. Better than cooking my self, although I do get a few of the cooking kits that are really quick to prepare."
"We have had a fantastic experience with Munchery meals, delivered on time, and beautifully prepared. The menus are wonderful, the food is fresh and nutritious and, importantly, delicious! We are fans!"
"We have ordered food from Munchery since its inception and have always been pleased with the quality, quantity and delivery. We will continue to order from them!"
"We have received excellent delivery service and the ordering is very simple. Sometimes the selection just doesn't fit with what we eat, but the preparation and quality of the food we get is very good."
We have recently come back to Munchery and have found the dinners we have ordered to be excellent.
"We love Munchery! It's a great option for the nights we cannot cook at home but still want healthy, delicious food. The variety is great, the delivery and service is super and the food is really good."
"We ordered wonderful, delicious meals from Munchery! They came the very next day and all we needed to do was heat them up! Highly recommend Munchery!"
"Well run company. Some dishes are good, others, not so much. I complained and got no response."
What has kept me from ordering more often is the huge increase in prices over the past year or two. It was much more affordable when we started ordering.
"When lettuce is part of the meal, make them bite size pieces. Sometimes the beef is not the tenderest of cuts"
Would prefer a wider choice of dishes-and less emphasis on chicken
Would recommend! Am a regular! Beats cooking any day!! Most of the meals are great.
You are the best ever! Do not change! I have tried them all and none compare. Love you!
"Yummy food great service and prices, what more could ya ask for?!?"
